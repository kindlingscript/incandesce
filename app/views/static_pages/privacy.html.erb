	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

	<br />

	<p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally identifiable information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.</p>

	<h4>What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our blog, website or app?</h4>

	<p>When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, credit card information or other details to help you with your experience.</p>

	<h4>When do we collect information?</h4>

	<p>We collect information from you when you register on our site, place an order or enter information on our site.</p>

	<h4>How do we use your information?</h4>

	<p>We may use the information we collect from you when you register, make a purchase, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways:

	      <ul>
	      	<li>To personalize user's experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested.</li>
	      	<li>To quickly process your transactions.</li>
	      </ul>
	
	<h4>How do we protect visitor information?</h4>

	<p>We do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards.</p>
	
	<p>We do not use Malware Scanning.</p>

	<p>We do not use an SSL certificate.</p>
	      
	<p>We do not need an SSL because: this is a website that was made for a development bootcamp -- any payments "collected" will be test only, no one will actually be charged (TL;DR: the app is an assignment for a web dev bootcamp, will not be actually "used" to collect anything of substance).</p>

	<h4>Do we use 'cookies'?</h4>

	<p>We do not use cookies for tracking purposes.</p>

	<h4>Third Party Disclosure</h4>

	<p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.</p>

	<h4>Google</h4>

	<p>Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users. https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en </p>

	<p>We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site: again, this was an assignment for a web development bootcamp, and I'm merely working through this to get a first feel for how privacy policies work when implementing them.</p>

	<h4>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h4>

	<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>

	<p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>
